# VoBLE

## ðŸš§ Work in Progress

This repository is under active development. Use at your own risk!

The goal is to have a simple program to read JK BMSes/Balancers via BLE and display the info in a nice GUI for use as a wall-mount display. (No HA, ESPHome, mobile app, etc.) Eventually I want to create a MicroPython version to use on a [CYD](https://github.com/witnessmenow/ESP32-Cheap-Yellow-Display)
